# Energy-prediction-using-data-mining-models

The main purpose of this workis to look at the possibility of using data mining methods to forecast energy use in industrial settings. The study is focused on predicting daily energy consumption patterns in a South Korean steel manufacturing factory utilising data mining techniques like machine learning algorithms and artificial neural networks. The goal of the study is to assess how well these models forecast energy consumption and to find areas where energy can be saved, efficiency can be increased and to offer information about how they might be used in real-world.  

In conclusion, the steel industry is one of the largest energy consumers in the world. To reduce its energy consumption and carbon emissions, the industry can benefit from the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to predict energy consumption and optimize processes. Various AI algorithms, such as Linear regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), have been used in the project work to predict energy consumption in the steel industry. Our research indicated that ANN performs better than other models and predict the energy consumption accurately. The use of ANN model to predict energy consumption can be extended to any other industry and can help reduce energy waste, optimize production, and minimize costs. ANN model can identify patterns and anomalies in energy consumption data and alert operators to take corrective action. This can help reduce energy consumption, improve energy efficiency, and reduce costs.
